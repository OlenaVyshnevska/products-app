# Products App
This is another react app that I built to test and practice mapping components in react.

### Installing depencencies and running the app

* Fork the repository

* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/<username>/products-app.git` where \< username \> is your username

* Install create-react-app: `npm install -g create-react-app`

* `cd products-app`

* `npm install`

* `npm start`

* Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser
